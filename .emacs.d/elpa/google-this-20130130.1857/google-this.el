;;; Commentary:

;; google-this is a package that provides a set of functions and
;; keybindings for launching google searches from within emacs.

;; The main function is `google-this' (bound to C-x g t). It does a
;; google search using the currently selected region, or the
;; expression under point. All functions are bound under "C-x g", to
;; see all keybindings type "C-x g C-h".

;; To start a blank search, do `google-search' (C-x g RET). If you
;; want more control of what "under point" means, there are the
;; `google-word', `google-symbol', `google-line' and
;; `google-region'functions, bound as w, s, l and r, respectively.

;; If the `google-wrap-in-quotes' variable is t, than searches are
;; enclosed by double quotes (default is NOT). If a prefix argument is
;; given to any of the functions, invert the effect of
;; `google-wrap-in-quotes'.

;; There is also a `google-error' (C-x g e) function. It checks the
;; current error in the compilation buffer, tries to do some parsing
;; (to remove file name, line number, etc), and googles it. It's still
;; experimental, and has only really been tested with gcc error
;; reports.

;;; Instructions:
